#  gRPC over browser Javascript: Using gRPC-Web on Google Kubernetes Engine Ingress


[grpc-web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web) offers a way to access your [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) API server from a modern browser.  Normally, API servers you call directly from browsers is plain `REST`...but its not well known that you can also call gRPC directly without involving [transcoding](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-httpjson-transcoding) or REST but a modification of the standard gRPC wire protocol adapted to account for browser limitations.  

So last wee i wanted to create a simple helloworld app for grpcWeb and succeded in doing that direclty on my laptop (you can see that sample [here](https://github.com/salrashid123/gcegrpc/tree/master/grpc-web).  As a further extension, I endedup adapting that sample sample to run on GKE direclty with its HTTP/2 Ingress resource capability.  That is, this sample deploys a simple webapp which from the browser calls a gRPC server!

The basic flow for this app would be:

1. browser requests a plain HTML page from a webserver on GKE (externally exposed via Ingress)
2. webserver responds back with html page including some javascript w/ grpc Client code
4. browser then issues grpc-web API call to the same Ingress endpoint but routed towards an Envoy proxy backend
5. envoy forwards gRPC request to your backend gRPC server over true `grpc://`
6. backend API responds back to request with unary or streamed response.

As a bonus, this sample also exposes the gRPC server's port directly.  This allows ordinary gRPC clients written in any language to connect and issue API requests.

You can read more about gRPC and gRPC-web in the references cited below.

## gRPC Transcoding vs gRPC Web vs gRPC Native

gRPC web should not be confused with gRPC Transcoding:  the former is a modification of gRPC protocol adapted for a browser (i.,e try to use `application/grpc` framing and separate out the `HTTP/2` framing not exposed to browsers).  Transcoding is a server-side capability that converts an inbound REST message into a backend gRPC request.

For more information, see [Protocol differences vs gRPC over HTTP2](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md#protocol-differences-vs-grpc-over-http2)


Google Cloud Enpoints supports this type of transcoding via annotations as described here
 -[https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/about-grpc](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/about-grpc)
 -[https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/transcoding](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/transcoding)

Here is an example hello-world app for gRPCTranscoding using Cloud Endpoints
- [Google Cloud Endpoints: REST and gRPC, gRPC+Transcoding](https://github.com/salrashid123/esp_docker)


## Cloud Endpoints support for gRPC-Web
 
  The example in this repo utilizes Envoy.  You can also use Google Cloud Endpoint's ESP proxy which provides basic grpc-web support in addition to other features/capabilities of Endpoints like API management.

- [https://github.com/cloudendpoints/esp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-1100-24-10-2017](https://github.com/cloudendpoints/esp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-1100-24-10-2017)


## Setup


### Allocate StaticIP 
 
 This step isn't necessary but use statically bound the name `gke-ingress` to the Ingress objects later

```
gcloud compute addresses create gke-ingress --global

gcloud compute addresses list
NAME         REGION  ADDRESS        STATUS
gke-ingress          35.241.41.138  RESERVED
```

### Edit /etc/hosts

Since this is just a demo/POC, statically set the IP to resolve to `.domain.com` as shown below

```
/etc/hosts
35.241.41.138 server.domain.com grpcweb.domain.com grpc.domain.com
```


### Create the GKE cluster

```
gcloud container  clusters create grpc-cluster --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --cluster-version=1.10.5 --zone us-central1-a  --num-nodes 3
```


### Build Components

You can either build ad upload the images to dockerhub or to your own Container Registry (`gcr.io/project...`).

If you choose to use the images I created and uploaded, skip this section to the "Deploy" part.


#### gRPC Backend

The gRPC backend is a golang app that simply Echo's back a message as Unary or Server Streaming (i.,e echo back the message three times).

There is the proto:

```
syntax = "proto3";

package echo;

service EchoServer {
  rpc SayHello (EchoRequest) returns (EchoReply) {}
  rpc SayHelloStream(EchoRequest) returns (stream EchoReply) {}  
}

message EchoRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message EchoReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```


You can either build the backend or use the one I uploaded here:

- `docker.io/salrashid123/grpc_backend`

To build, simply run the following and upload

```
cd backend_grpc
docker build -t your_registry/grpc_backend .
```

The grpc_backend listens on port `:50051` so to run it localy, execute something like:

```
 docker run  -p 50051:50051 -t salrashid123/grpc_backend ./grpc_server -grpcport 0.0.0.0:50051
```

You can even test the grpc Client locally by running

```
docker run --add-host grpc.domain.com:127.0.0.1 -t salrashid123/grpc_backend /grpc_client --host grpc.domain.com:50051
```

#### Frontend

You can either build the backend or use the one I uploaded here

- `docker.io/salrashid123/web_frontend`

```
cd frontend
docker build -t your_registry/web_frontend .
```

The frontend listens on port `:8000` so to run it localy, execute something like:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 salrashid123/web_frontend
```

#### Envoy

You can either build the envoyproxy container or use the one I uploaded here

- `docker.io/salrashid123/grpc_envoyproxy`

```
cd backend_envoy
docker build -t your_registry/grpc_envoyproxy .
```

The grpc_proxy listens on port `:18080`. You can run it locally within a docker file but you'll need to network it with a backend to use it easily.


## Deploy


If you choose to use the images I uploaded, just run:

```
$ kubectl apply -f .
```

Otherwise, edit each yaml file under `gke_config/` folder and change the image reference to your registry.


Once you deploy, you should see the deploymets and the staticIP attached to the Ingress object:

```bash
$ kubectl get no,po,rc,svc,ing,deployments,secrets

```

> *NOTE:* Deployment and availability of the endpoint IP may take `8->10minutes`

## Browser

Trust the `CA_crt.pem` file in Firefox since its self-singed.  Open up `Firefox` and under the Advanced settings, enable trust for the CA (you don't have to but its easier this way)

- ![images/cert_trust.png](images/cert_trust.png)


Now go to `https://server.domain.com/`.  You should see the nodejs Frontend,  You may wan to open up developer tools to see the request/response streams

Click the `Submit` button.  WHat that will do is transmit 1 unary request and 1 server-streaming request.  The unary request will respond back with the hostname that handled the request.   Below that you should see three RPC responses back from the server request.

Here is a sample Request-Response from the browser

- Request
```
Host: grpcweb.domain.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0

```

- Response

```

## gRPC Client

The setup here also enables direct gRPC client calls outside of a browser.  This means you can use any gRPC client directly.  In the example below, we are using a golang gRPC client (remember to change the IP address to your Ingress's IP before invoking)

```
$ docker run --add-host grpc.domain.com:35.241.41.138  -t gcr.io/mineral-minutia-820/grpc_backend /grpc_client --host grpc.domain.com:443
2018/09/03 15:55:33 RPC Response: 0 message:"Hello unary RPC msg   from hostname be-deployment-68c7bfd9f9-5hccn" 
2018/09/03 15:55:34 RPC Response: 1 message:"Hello unary RPC msg   from hostname be-deployment-68c7bfd9f9-5hccn" 
2018/09/03 15:55:35 RPC Response: 2 message:"Hello unary RPC msg   from hostname be-deployment-68c7bfd9f9-c7fth" 
2018/09/03 15:55:36 RPC Response: 3 message:"Hello unary RPC msg   from hostname be-deployment-68c7bfd9f9-c7fth" 
2018/09/03 15:55:37 RPC Response: 4 message:"Hello unary RPC msg   from hostname be-deployment-68c7bfd9f9-c7fth" 
2018/09/03 15:55:38 RPC Response: 5 message:"Hello unary RPC msg   from hostname be-deployment-68c7bfd9f9-5hccn" 
2018/09/03 15:55:39 RPC Response: 6 message:"Hello unary RPC msg   from hostname be-deployment-68c7bfd9f9-5hccn" 
```

The response shows the backends that handled each request.  Note that the responses are from different backends over a *single* connection.  THis is as expected since the GCP L7 loadbalancer (Ingress), send each RPC to different pods to balance loads.

## Conclusion

`gRPC-web` and `gRPC` offers many advantages to API developers thats inherent in the protocol and toolchains.  Before you jump in, please read through what you actually need/want from your API and clients.  Often enough, for low-intensity APIs or simple clients, `REST` is a perfectly fine to use (easy to use, easy to setup; widespread support, etc)...it just depends on your current and future needs.

Anyway, hope this article helps bridge some the gaps and shows how you can use `grpc-web` on GKE.  You ofcourse do not need to use GKE...take a look at the examples in the reference section below to get started locally or on any platform.

## Appendix

### Openssl

The CA Certificate and server certificate in this repo is the same and shared across all the components.  If you wanted to test this repo out with your own self-signed certs, you can use the following procedure to gerneate your own CA and server certificates.

- Setup the serial and index file for openssl
```
cd certs
mkdir new_certs
touch index.txt
echo 00 > serial
```

- Generate the CA certificate and key
```
openssl genrsa -out CA_key.pem 2048
openssl req -x509 -days 600 -new -nodes -key CA_key.pem -out CA_crt.pem -extensions v3_ca -config openssl.cnf    -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Google/OU=Enterprise/CN=MyCA"
```

- Edit `openssl.cnf` and set the  SNI values as needed

`
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = server.domain.com
DNS.2 = grpc.domain.com
DNS.3 = grpcweb.domain.com
DNS.4 = localhost
`

- Generate the server certificates
```
openssl genrsa -out server_key.pem 2048
openssl req -config openssl.cnf -days 400 -out server_csr.pem -key server_key.pem -new -sha256  -extensions v3_req  -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Google/OU=Enterprise/CN=server.domain.com"
openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -days 400 -notext  -in server_csr.pem   -out server_crt.pem
```

- Copy the `.pem` files to each folder (`frontend/`, `backend_grpc/`, `backend_envoy`).
- Edit `gke_config/fe-secret.yaml` and place the base64 encoded version of the server cert/key file as the tls key and cert.
